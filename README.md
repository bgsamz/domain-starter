# buildspace DNS starter project

My own implementation of the @_buildspace DNS starter project. This project uses Spotify links as your record! Users can
then set their record to their favorite Spotify song and have the webapp dynamically update the embedded Spotify widget
to view their own favorite song, or the song attached to some other domain!
